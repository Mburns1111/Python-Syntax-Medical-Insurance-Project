Now you know enough about 
strings

 that we can start doing the really fun stuff!

Because strings are 
lists

, that means we can iterate through a string using for or while 
loops

. This opens up a whole range of possibilities of ways we can manipulate and analyze strings. Let’s take a look at an example.

def print_each_letter(word):
  for letter in word:
    print(letter)

Copy to Clipboard

This code will iterate through each letter in a given word and will print it to the terminal.

favorite_color = "blue"
print_each_letter(favorite_color)
# => 'b'
# => 'l'
# => 'u'
# => 'e'

Let’s

 a couple of problems where we need to iterate through a string.

Instructions
Checkpoint 1 Passed
1.
Let’s replicate a function you are already familiar with, len().

Write a new function called get_length() that takes a string as an input and returns the number of characters in that string. Do this by iterating through the string. Do not use the len() function!

def get_length(word):
  counter = 0
  for letter in word:
    counter += 1
  return counter
