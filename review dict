So far we have learned:

How to create a dictionary
How to add elements to a dictionary
How to update elements in a dictionary
How to use a dict comprehension to create a dictionary from two lists
Let’s practice these skills!

Instructions
Checkpoint 1 Passed
1.
We are building a music streaming service. We have provided two lists, representing songs in a user’s library and the amount of times each song has been played.

Using a dict comprehension, create a dictionary called plays that goes through zip(songs, playcounts) and creates a song:playcount pair for each song in songs and each playcount in playcounts.

Checkpoint 2 Passed
2.
Print plays.

Checkpoint 3 Passed
3.
After printing plays, add a new entry to it. The entry should be for the song "Purple Haze" and the playcount is 1.

Checkpoint 4 Passed
4.
This user has caught Aretha Franklin fever and listened to “Respect” 5 more times. Update the value for "Respect" to be 94 in the plays dictionary.

Checkpoint 5 Passed
5.
Create a dictionary called library that has two key: value pairs:

key "The Best Songs" with a value of plays, the dictionary you created
key "Sunday Feelings" with a value of an empty dictionary
Remember, to create a dictionary, you can use the {} syntax. You can then add key-value pairs inside this syntax, separating the key and value with a colon : and different pairs with a comma ,. For the "Sunday Feelings" key, you can assign an empty dictionary as its value by using {}.

Checkpoint 6 Passed
6.
Print library.

songs = ["Like a Rolling Stone", "Satisfaction", "Imagine", "What's Going On", "Respect", "Good Vibrations"]
playcounts = [78, 29, 44, 21, 89, 5]

plays = {key:value for key, value in zip(songs, playcounts)}
print(plays)

plays["Purple Haze"]=1
plays["Respect"]=94

library ={"The Best Songs":plays, "Sunday Feelings":{}}
print(library)
